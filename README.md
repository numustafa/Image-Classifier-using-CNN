# Image-Classifier-using-CNN
This is the project I did to stamp my learning journey in CNN. in this project, the main goal is to use the CNN and build an image classifier. Afterwards, improving accuracy of the classifier using Data Augmentation techeniques. This project is a building block of my learning in Deep learning with TF and keras.

## About the project
Image Classification (also called Image Recognition) is the process of labeling or categorizing an image from a set of predefined target classes. Traditionally, in machine learning, image classification solutions involved computing various types of features that were engineered for a particular problem domain. These features were then used as input to train a classifier, such as a Support Vector Machine (SVM) or multinomial Logistics Regression.

With the advent of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the process has shifted to a more end-to-end learning process (instead of learning only the classifier). In contrast to traditional machine learning techniques, the features are also learned during the training of the CNNs. Deep CNNs can learn to classify images into thousands of classes. These networks also form the basis for many advanced computer vision problems like Segmentation and Object Detection. In this project, I will be building a classifier on a balls dataset to perform image classification using a hard-coded deep CNN. The content of the project are:
1. Dataset Exploration
2. Data preprocessing
3. Train a Deep Neural Network Model
4. Model Evaluation
5. Conclusion
